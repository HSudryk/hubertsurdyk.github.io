        <h3>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h3>
        <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
        <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
        <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

        <h3>Reflections on Reading "Wesele" by Wyspiański</h3>
        <p>Reading Wyspiański's "Wesele" was unexpectedly challenging. The play is dense with symbolism, cultural references, and historical context that are not immediately accessible. Each character embodies social and national archetypes, making it complex to interpret their dialogue. The poetic language and metaphors required me to pause frequently, annotate the text, and consult explanatory notes to fully grasp the meaning.</p>
        <p>The social and historical layers were particularly demanding. References to Poland's partitions, rural customs, and political commentary created a text that cannot be understood superficially. For example, understanding the nuanced satire in the Poet’s and Farmer’s interactions required careful consideration of the societal tensions of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the intellectual effort was rewarding. I reflected on the symbolic wedding scene, analyzing how Wyspiański blends realism and allegory to critique national identity. This process deepened my appreciation for literature as a mirror of society and encouraged critical thinking, patience, and analytical skills.</p>
        <p>Overall, "Wesele" is a rich, layered work that challenges readers to engage deeply with language, history, and social critique. The experience emphasized the importance of context, reflection, and collaborative discussion when tackling complex texts.</p>

        <h3>Observation of a Dead Bird on the Sidewalk</h3>
        <p>Walking down the street, I encountered a small dead bird on the sidewalk. Its sudden stillness caught my attention, prompting reflection on mortality, fragility, and urban life. The bird, likely a sparrow, became a symbol of unnoticed events in everyday life. Observing it led me to contemplate the invisible struggles of wildlife in cities, the unpredictability of life, and the human tendency to overlook minor but meaningful occurrences.</p>
        <p>The moment sparked broader reflection. It highlighted the importance of mindfulness, empathy, and environmental responsibility. It reminded me that attention to small details can cultivate awareness and compassion, both for living creatures and societal issues. Documenting this experience allowed me to process the observation thoughtfully and turn it into a narrative that emphasizes reflection and learning from everyday encounters.</p>

    <h2>Analytical Corner</h2>
    <p>On the night of September 9–10, multiple drones entered Polish airspace. NATO forces, including Polish, Dutch, and German units, responded effectively, neutralizing the threats. I interpret this as a Russian test of NATO readiness rather than a direct attack. The incident demonstrates hybrid warfare tactics and highlights the importance of collective defense strategies.</p>
    <p>Analyzing such events requires attention to historical context, military logistics, and geopolitical interests. For example, Belarus may have played a diplomatic but passive role, warning neighbors while avoiding escalation. Understanding these dynamics helps citizens critically assess political statements and media reports, forming evidence-based opinions.</p>
    <p>Moreover, these events have economic and social implications, such as influencing energy policy and defense budgets. Linking analytical insights to broader societal effects ensures a holistic perspective, encouraging readers to consider cause, effect, and long-term consequences in complex international issues.</p>
