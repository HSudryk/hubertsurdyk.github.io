        <h3>"30 Door Key" – A Film That Resists Easy Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
            <em>30 Door Key</em>, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski and based on Witold Gombrowicz’s novel
            <em>Ferdydurke</em>, is a film that deliberately challenges the viewer’s expectations.
            Instead of telling a clear and coherent story, it immerses the audience in a surreal
            sequence of events that often feel illogical or unsettling. This narrative confusion is
            not a flaw, but a conscious artistic choice that reflects the philosophical foundations
            of Gombrowicz’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The film explores themes of immaturity, identity, and social pressure. Characters behave
            in exaggerated or absurd ways, and many scenes seem disconnected from one another.
            Traditional cause-and-effect storytelling is replaced by symbolism and atmosphere,
            which can make the film difficult to understand on a first viewing. The viewer is not
            guided toward meaning but instead forced to actively interpret what is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach can be frustrating, especially for audiences accustomed to conventional
            cinema. However, the confusion mirrors the protagonist’s internal struggle and the
            novel’s critique of rigid social forms. <em>30 Door Key</em> functions less as a narrative
            film and more as a philosophical experiment. While it is undeniably challenging and
            often obscure, it rewards patience and reflection, offering a unique and intellectually
            demanding cinematic experience.

        <h3>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h3>
        <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
        <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
        <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

        <h3>Drone Attack on the Night of September 9–10: A Test for NATO?</h3>
        <p>The drone incident on the night of September 9–10 was one of the most serious cross-border security events in recent months. According to official sources, several drones entered Polish airspace and were successfully intercepted and neutralized through coordinated efforts involving Polish, Dutch, and German forces under NATO command. The alliance’s quick and effective response showed that cooperation is working and that NATO’s integrated air defense system is functioning as it should.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, this was most likely a Russian operation — not necessarily a direct attack, but rather a test of NATO’s readiness and airspace defense. Some people have suggested that the drones might have come from Ukraine, but there’s no solid evidence to support that claim.</p>
        <p>There are also some interesting theories regarding Belarus’s role. It’s possible that the Belarusian authorities themselves don’t have full control or even full knowledge of what Russian troops stationed in Belarus are doing.</p>
        <p>All in all, NATO passed this test — but it’s a clear reminder that the region remains tense and that hybrid threats are very real.</p>

        <h3>School Elections: Igor Becomes Vice President</h3>
        <p>Last week, our school held elections for the student council. One of my classmates, Igor, ran for the position of student council president — and although he didn’t win the top spot, he came in second and was appointed vice president.</p>
        <p>Igor launched his campaign just one day before the election. Unlike other candidates, who had been putting up posters and campaigning for several days, Igor went for a completely different approach.</p>
        <p>I helped him out a little with the project, mostly by giving some input on the poster designs and helping him hang them around the school.</p>
        <p>Despite the late start and limited materials, Igor managed to outperform several candidates.</p>

        <h3>Reflections on Reading "Wesele" by Wyspiański</h3>
        <p>Reading Wyspiański's "Wesele" was unexpectedly challenging. The play is dense with symbolism, cultural references, and historical context that are not immediately accessible. Each character embodies social and national archetypes, making it complex to interpret their dialogue. The poetic language and metaphors required me to pause frequently, annotate the text, and consult explanatory notes to fully grasp the meaning.</p>
        <p>The social and historical layers were particularly demanding. References to Poland's partitions, rural customs, and political commentary created a text that cannot be understood superficially. For example, understanding the nuanced satire in the Poet’s and Farmer’s interactions required careful consideration of the societal tensions of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the intellectual effort was rewarding. I reflected on the symbolic wedding scene, analyzing how Wyspiański blends realism and allegory to critique national identity. This process deepened my appreciation for literature as a mirror of society and encouraged critical thinking, patience, and analytical skills.</p>
        <p>Overall, "Wesele" is a rich, layered work that challenges readers to engage deeply with language, history, and social critique. The experience emphasized the importance of context, reflection, and collaborative discussion when tackling complex texts.</p>

        <h3>Observation of a Dead Bird on the Sidewalk</h3>
        <p>Walking down the street, I encountered a small dead bird on the sidewalk. Its sudden stillness caught my attention, prompting reflection on mortality, fragility, and urban life. The bird, likely a sparrow, became a symbol of unnoticed events in everyday life. Observing it led me to contemplate the invisible struggles of wildlife in cities, the unpredictability of life, and the human tendency to overlook minor but meaningful occurrences.</p>
        <p>The moment sparked broader reflection. It highlighted the importance of mindfulness, empathy, and environmental responsibility. It reminded me that attention to small details can cultivate awareness and compassion, both for living creatures and societal issues. Documenting this experience allowed me to process the observation thoughtfully and turn it into a narrative that emphasizes reflection and learning from everyday encounters.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the sight of the bird reminded me that observation, reflection, and writing are powerful tools for understanding our environment and our place within it. It encourages me to be more attentive, both in daily life and in the broader context of society, where noticing and responding to small events can lead to greater awareness and positive action.</p>

        <h3>A Cashmere Scarf from Uniqlo on Marszałkowska Street</h3>
        <p>On a cold afternoon in Warsaw, I found myself walking down Marszałkowska Street, one of the city’s most recognizable and lively avenues. Winter was clearly making itself felt, and the sharp air made me realize that my usual accessories were no longer enough. Almost instinctively, I stepped into the Uniqlo store, which has become a familiar and reliable presence in the city center.</p>
        <p>The store was busy but well organized, as Uniqlo stores usually are. Clean lines, neutral colors, and a sense of calm order contrasted nicely with the noisy street outside. I wasn’t planning a long shopping session; I had one specific goal in mind. After browsing for a few minutes, I found what I was looking for: a simple, elegant cashmere scarf.</p>
        <p>The scarf immediately stood out because of its softness and understated design. It wasn’t flashy or covered in logos, which I appreciated. Instead, it felt timeless and practical, something that would work equally well with a winter coat or a more casual jacket. When I touched the fabric, the quality was obvious. Cashmere has a way of feeling warm and light at the same time, and this scarf was no exception.</p>
        <p>What also struck me was the price. For cashmere, it felt reasonable, especially considering the quality and craftsmanship. Uniqlo has built its reputation on offering well-made basics without unnecessary extravagance, and this scarf perfectly reflected that philosophy.</p>
        <p>After paying, I wrapped the scarf around my neck before even leaving the store. Stepping back onto Marszałkowska Street, I immediately felt warmer and more comfortable. It was a small purchase, but one that noticeably improved an ordinary winter day in Warsaw.</p>

        <h3>Why Threatening Greenland Makes Little Sense</h3>
        <p>Recent statements by Donald Trump suggesting threats or pressure toward Greenland are not only controversial but also deeply misguided. From a legal and geopolitical perspective, such rhetoric ignores the existing framework of agreements that already define the relationship between the United States, Denmark, and Greenland.</p>
        <p>First, there is the Danish-American defense agreement, which has been in place for decades. This treaty allows the United States extensive military access and operational freedom on Greenlandic territory. In practical terms, American forces already enjoy both de facto and de jure rights to operate in Greenland for defense purposes. The Thule Air Base is a clear and long-standing example of this cooperation.</p>
        <p>Second, subsequent agreements between the United States and Greenlandic authorities further reinforce this arrangement. These frameworks recognize Greenland’s political autonomy while still enabling close military and strategic collaboration with the U.S. In other words, American strategic interests in the region are already well secured without any need for intimidation or provocative language.</p>
        <p>Threatening Greenland, or implying that it could be taken or coerced, undermines alliances rather than strengthening them. Denmark is a NATO ally, and Greenland is part of a broader transatlantic security structure. Aggressive rhetoric risks damaging trust, not only with Copenhagen and Nuuk, but also with other partners who value stability and respect for international law.</p>
        <p>In a time when Arctic cooperation is increasingly important due to climate change and global security concerns, diplomacy and respect for existing treaties are essential. The United States already has what it needs in Greenland through legal agreements and mutual cooperation. From this perspective, threats are not only unnecessary—they are simply foolish.</p>

        <h3>winter olimpics curling mixed doubles</h3>
        <p>The victory of Sweden in the mixed doubles curling tournament at the Winter Olympics 2026 marked one of the most memorable moments of the Games and confirmed the nation’s long-standing dominance in the sport. Curling has deep roots in Swedish winter culture, and expectations were high even before the first stones were thrown. Still, the path to gold was far from easy, as the competition featured strong teams from traditional curling powers such as Canada, Great Britain, and Switzerland.
From the opening round-robin matches, the Swedish pair demonstrated remarkable precision, tactical intelligence, and emotional composure. Mixed doubles curling is a fast-paced and strategic format, where each team has only five stones per end and must balance aggressive shot-making with careful defensive play. The Swedish duo excelled in both areas. Their communication was constant and calm, their sweeping was perfectly timed, and their shot selection showed a deep understanding of angles, weight control, and scoring opportunities.
One of the defining features of their performance was consistency. While other teams struggled with the changing ice conditions and the pressure of Olympic competition, the Swedish players maintained a steady level of play throughout the tournament. They rarely missed key draws and were especially effective at executing takeouts under pressure. Their ability to score multiple points when holding the hammer and to force their opponents into single-point ends when defending gave them a crucial statistical edge.
The semifinal match was widely regarded as the turning point. Facing a highly experienced opponent, the Swedish team fell behind early but responded with patience rather than panic. In the fifth end they produced a perfectly placed freeze that shifted the momentum, followed by a precise double takeout in the sixth that tied the game. From that moment onward, they controlled the pace and secured a narrow but well-earned victory, advancing to the gold medal match.
The final itself was a showcase of elite curling. Both teams played at an extraordinary level, trading points in tightly contested ends. The Swedish pair relied on their hallmark strategy: keeping the center guarded early, building pressure, and capitalizing on small positional advantages. In the decisive final end, with the score tied and the last stone in their hands, they delivered a flawless draw to the button, igniting celebrations among teammates, coaches, and fans.
Beyond the technical brilliance, the win carried symbolic significance. It reinforced the country’s reputation as one of the world’s leading curling nations and highlighted the effectiveness of its development system, which emphasizes youth training, sports science, and international competition experience. Mixed doubles, in particular, has grown rapidly since its Olympic introduction, and this gold medal demonstrated how well Sweden adapted to the unique demands of the discipline.
The triumph also captured the spirit of the Winter Games: precision, teamwork, resilience, and respect between competitors. After the final stone, both teams exchanged smiles and handshakes, embodying the tradition of sportsmanship that defines curling culture
For Swedish fans, the victory was a source of national pride and a reminder of the country’s deep connection to winter sports. For the global curling community, it was a masterclass in strategy and execution. The 2026 Olympic mixed doubles tournament will be remembered not only for its dramatic matches but also for the calm excellence of the Swedish champions, whose performance set a new standard for the sport.</p>

    <h2>Analytical Corner</h2>
    <p>Donald Trump’s repeated threats and insinuations toward Denmark, particularly regarding Greenland, represent not merely diplomatic impropriety but a deeper crisis in American strategic culture. These statements, oscillating between coercive rhetoric and transactional cynicism, expose a troubling tendency to treat allies as subordinate assets rather than sovereign partners. When examined through the lenses of military infrastructure, legal frameworks, and geopolitical tradition, Trump’s posture toward Denmark appears not only aggressive but fundamentally destabilizing for the transatlantic order.
    At the center of this controversy lies Greenland and the strategic importance of the former Thule Air Base, renamed Pituffik Space Base in 2023. This installation has long been a cornerstone of NATO’s northern defense architecture and of U.S. missile warning systems during both the Cold War and the contemporary era of renewed great-power competition. Crucially, however, the base exists not by American entitlement, but by Danish consent. Its legal foundation is the 1951 Danish–American Defense Agreement on Greenland, a treaty negotiated in the shadow of Cold War necessity, yet firmly grounded in respect for Danish sovereignty. Trump’s rhetoric, which implicitly questioned Denmark’s control over Greenland or suggested outright acquisition, undermined the very legal and moral basis on which American presence there rests.
    Such behavior reveals a broader American inconsistency. The United States frequently proclaims itself the guardian of a “rules-based international order,” yet Trump’s threats toward Denmark contradicted this principle in both tone and substance. By treating Greenland as a purchasable commodity and Denmark as an obstacle rather than an ally, Trump echoed a 19th-century imperial mindset unsuited to a world of sovereign states and legal commitments. This was not strategic realism; it was strategic arrogance.
    From a European, and particularly Gaullist, perspective, this episode reinforces long-standing doubts about excessive reliance on American leadership. Charles de Gaulle consistently argued that true alliances must be founded on equality, dignity, and national independence. Trump’s approach demonstrated the opposite: a vision of alliances as asymmetric arrangements in which Europe is expected to comply, contribute, and remain silent. Denmark’s firm yet measured response—defending its sovereignty without descending into hysteria—stood in sharp contrast to Trump’s impulsive rhetoric and deserves recognition as a model of European statecraft.
    Moreover, Europe as a whole emerges from this episode with moral and political credit. The European commitment to multilateralism, international law, and institutional continuity appears increasingly mature when compared to the volatility of American domestic politics. While Europe is often criticized for strategic hesitation, Trump’s threats ironically strengthen the argument for greater European strategic autonomy. A continent capable of defending its interests collectively is not anti-American; it is responsibly sovereign.
    Criticism of Trump does not equate to hostility toward the United States as a nation. Rather, it is a critique of a leadership style that weakens American credibility and alienates allies at a time when unity is essential. By disregarding treaties such as the 1951 agreement and trivializing the diplomatic partnership that sustains bases like Pituffik, Trump diminished the very foundations of U.S. power projection.
    In conclusion, Trump’s threats toward Denmark were not an isolated scandal but a symptom of a deeper transatlantic imbalance. Europe, acting in a Gaullist spirit of independence and dignity, has shown that loyalty does not require submission. If the Atlantic alliance is to endure, it must be rebuilt on mutual respect—not on coercion, spectacle, or nostalgia for imperial dominance.</p>
