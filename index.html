        <h3>"30 Door Key" – A Challenging Film Adaptation</h3>
        <p>
            <em>30 Door Key</em>, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski and inspired by Witold Gombrowicz’s novel
            <em>Ferdydurke</em>, is a film that deliberately avoids clear explanations and conventional
            storytelling. Rather than guiding the viewer through a logical plot, the movie presents a
            sequence of surreal situations that reflect the novel’s themes of immaturity, identity, and
            social pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The film is difficult to understand because it relies heavily on symbolism and absurdity.
            Characters behave in exaggerated or illogical ways, and many scenes seem disconnected at
            first glance. This confusion is intentional: Skolimowski translates Gombrowicz’s literary
            philosophy into visual form, forcing the audience to question what is real, meaningful, or
            merely imposed by society.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, <em>30 Door Key</em> can feel frustrating, especially for viewers expecting a
            traditional narrative. However, those who approach it as a philosophical experience rather
            than a standard film may appreciate its depth. The movie rewards patience and reflection,
            offering insight into conformity, personal freedom, and the absurdity of growing up. It is
            not easy to grasp, but it is intellectually stimulating.

        <h3>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h3>
        <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
        <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
        <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

        <h3>Drone Attack on the Night of September 9–10: A Test for NATO?</h3>
        <p>The drone incident on the night of September 9–10 was one of the most serious cross-border security events in recent months. According to official sources, several drones entered Polish airspace and were successfully intercepted and neutralized through coordinated efforts involving Polish, Dutch, and German forces under NATO command.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, this was most likely a Russian operation — not necessarily a direct attack, but rather a test of NATO’s readiness and airspace defense.</p>
        <p>There are also some interesting theories regarding Belarus’s role. It’s possible that the Belarusian authorities themselves don’t have full control or even full knowledge of what Russian troops stationed in Belarus are doing.</p>
        <p>All in all, NATO passed this test — but it’s a clear reminder that the region remains tense and that hybrid threats are very real.</p>

        <h3>School Elections: Igor Becomes Vice President</h3>
        <p>Last week, our school held elections for the student council. One of my classmates, Igor, ran for the position of student council president.</p>
        <p>Igor launched his campaign just one day before the election.</p>
        <p>I helped him out a little with the project.</p>
        <p>Despite the late start, Igor achieved an impressive result.</p>

        <h3>Reflections on Reading "Wesele" by Wyspiański</h3>
        <p>Reading Wyspiański's "Wesele" was unexpectedly challenging.</p>
        <p>The social and historical layers were particularly demanding.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the intellectual effort was rewarding.</p>
        <p>Overall, "Wesele" is a rich, layered work.</p>

        <p>Walking down the street, I encountered a small dead bird on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>The moment sparked broader reflection.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the sight of the bird reminded me of mindfulness.</p>
