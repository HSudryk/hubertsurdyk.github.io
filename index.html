            <h2>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h2>
            <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
            <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
            <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

            <h2>Drone Attack on the Night of September 9–10: A Test for NATO?</h2>
            <p>The drone incident on the night of September 9–10 was one of the most serious cross-border security events in recent months. According to official sources, several drones entered Polish airspace and were successfully intercepted and neutralized through coordinated efforts involving Polish, Dutch, and German forces under NATO command. The alliance’s quick and effective response showed that cooperation is working and that NATO’s integrated air defense system is functioning as it should.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, this was most likely a Russian operation — not necessarily a direct attack, but rather a test of NATO’s readiness and airspace defense. Some people have suggested that the drones might have come from Ukraine, but there’s no solid evidence to support that claim. In fact, such theories may serve Russian interests by sowing confusion and distrust within the alliance.</p>
            <p>There are also some interesting theories regarding Belarus’s role. It’s possible that the Belarusian authorities themselves don’t have full control or even full knowledge of what Russian troops stationed in Belarus are doing. Some speculate that Minsk feared a strong military reaction — that in the event of a successful strike, the Bundeswehr and Polish Armed Forces could “push east” in response. Belarus has officially stated that it warned both Lithuania and Poland about incoming drones, which could suggest it was trying to avoid escalation — or at least cover itself diplomatically.</p>
            <p>All in all, NATO passed this test — but it’s a clear reminder that the region remains tense and that hybrid threats are very real.</p>

            <h2>School Elections: Igor Becomes Vice President</h2>
            <p>Last week, our school held elections for the student council. One of my classmates, Igor, ran for the position of student council president — and although he didn’t win the top spot, he came in second and was appointed vice president. Considering how little time he had to prepare, that’s a really impressive result.</p>
            <p>Igor launched his campaign just one day before the election. Unlike other candidates, who had been putting up posters, handing out flyers, and campaigning for several days, Igor went for a completely different approach. His posters were inspired by American World War II propaganda and visuals from Orwell’s <em>1984</em>. The style was bold, ironic, and a bit absurd — but it definitely stood out.</p>
            <p>I helped him out a little with the project, mostly by giving some input on the poster designs and helping him hang them around the school. It wasn’t a huge contribution, but it was interesting to be part of such an unconventional campaign.</p>
            <p>Despite the late start and limited materials, Igor managed to outperform several candidates who had run more traditional and aggressive campaigns. Now that he’s the student council vice president, it’ll be interesting to see how he applies that same creativity in his new role.</p>
