        <h3>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h3>
        <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
        <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
        <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

        <h3>Drone Attack on the Night of September 9–10: A Test for NATO?</h3>
        <p>The drone incident on the night of September 9–10 was one of the most serious cross-border security events in recent months. According to official sources, several drones entered Polish airspace and were successfully intercepted and neutralized through coordinated efforts involving Polish, Dutch, and German forces under NATO command. The alliance’s quick and effective response showed that cooperation is working and that NATO’s integrated air defense system is functioning as it should.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, this was most likely a Russian operation — not necessarily a direct attack, but rather a test of NATO’s readiness and airspace defense. Some people have suggested that the drones might have come from Ukraine, but there’s no solid evidence to support that claim. In fact, such theories may serve Russian interests by sowing confusion and distrust within the alliance.</p>
        <p>There are also some interesting theories regarding Belarus’s role. It’s possible that the Belarusian authorities themselves don’t have full control or even full knowledge of what Russian troops stationed in Belarus are doing. Some speculate that Minsk feared a strong military reaction — that in the event of a successful strike, the Bundeswehr and Polish Armed Forces could “push east” in response. Belarus has officially stated that it warned both Lithuania and Poland about incoming drones, which could suggest it was trying to avoid escalation — or at least cover itself diplomatically.</p>
        <p>All in all, NATO passed this test — but it’s a clear reminder that the region remains tense and that hybrid threats are very real.</p>

        <h3>School Elections: Igor Becomes Vice President</h3>
        <p>Last week, our school held elections for the student council. One of my classmates, Igor, ran for the position of student council president — and although he didn’t win the top spot, he came in second and was appointed vice president. Considering how little time he had to prepare, that’s a really impressive result.</p>
        <p>Igor launched his campaign just one day before the election. Unlike other candidates, who had been putting up posters, handing out flyers, and campaigning for several days, Igor went for a completely different approach. His posters were inspired by American World War II propaganda and visuals from Orwell’s 1984. The style was bold, ironic, and a bit absurd — but it definitely stood out.</p>
        <p>I helped him out a little with the project, mostly by giving some input on the poster designs and helping him hang them around the school. It wasn’t a huge contribution, but it was interesting to be part of such an unconventional campaign.</p>
        <p>Despite the late start and limited materials, Igor managed to outperform several candidates who had run more traditional and aggressive campaigns. Now that he’s the student council vice president, it’ll be interesting to see how he applies that same creativity in his new role.</p>

<section id="analytical">
    <h2>Analytical Corner</h2>
    <p>In this section, I provide in-depth analysis of current cultural, political, and economic events. For example, the recent developments in global supply chains reveal how interdependent economies are today. Inflation rates, driven by energy crises and geopolitical tensions, directly affect both individual households and international trade. Through these observations, I explore both immediate impacts and potential long-term trends.</p>
    <p>Another critical topic is the rapid evolution of AI technology. While AI promises efficiency and innovation, it also raises ethical dilemmas regarding privacy, surveillance, and employment. I analyze multiple perspectives from articles and expert reports, then provide my own conclusions about how nations and organizations can respond responsibly. The goal is to develop critical thinking skills and encourage readers to question narratives rather than accept them passively.</p>
    <p>Finally, I link each analysis to broader societal implications. For instance, understanding NATO’s security drills, hybrid threats, and regional tensions helps citizens contextualize local policy decisions. By sharing my critical opinion and linking to reliable sources, this corner becomes a space for reflective, thoughtful engagement with the world.</p>

<section id="volunteering">
    <h2>English in Action</h2>
    <p>“English in Action” highlights practical volunteering opportunities where English and technical skills can make a meaningful impact. For example, contributing to open-source translation projects such as translating documentation for international coding frameworks helps communities access knowledge in multiple languages. Similarly, volunteering to teach English online for NGOs allows underserved learners to gain communication skills for education and employment.</p>
    <p>In addition, tech-savvy volunteers can support global initiatives by localizing software or educational platforms. Participating in citizen science projects in English, writing guides, or creating tutorials also sharpens language proficiency while creating tangible value. By actively engaging with these opportunities, students not only practice English but also develop collaboration, leadership, and problem-solving skills in authentic contexts.</p>

<section id="resources">
    <h2>Curated Resources</h2>
    <p>Curated Resources serves as a repository for materials that aid learning and creativity. For coding, I recommend free online tutorials like "freeCodeCamp" and "MDN Web Docs," which provide comprehensive, step-by-step guidance. For language acquisition, platforms like Duolingo and LingQ offer structured and engaging exercises. Documentary recommendations include "Inside Bill’s Brain" and "Abstract: The Art of Design," which stimulate critical thinking and innovation.</p>
    <p>This section also contains reviews of each resource, explaining why it is effective and how it can be applied practically. By organizing and sharing these resources, I aim to support peers in developing digital literacy, language proficiency, and creative problem-solving skills.</p>
</section>

<section id="lexicon">
    <h2>Lexicon Lab</h2>
    <p>Lexicon Lab is designed for active vocabulary practice. Each week, I select idioms and advanced phrases to incorporate into analytical essays. For instance, I recently explored "to fly under the radar" and "a double-edged sword" in essays discussing geopolitics and technology. Short quizzes accompany each essay to reinforce understanding.</p>
    <p>This approach ensures that C1-level vocabulary is not only recognized but applied in meaningful contexts. The lab encourages critical thinking, precise expression, and the ability to convey nuanced opinions in English. Peer contributions are also welcome, making it an interactive learning environment.</p>
