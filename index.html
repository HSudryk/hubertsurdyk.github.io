        <h3>"30 Door Key" – A Film That Resists Easy Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
            <em>30 Door Key</em>, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski and based on Witold Gombrowicz’s novel
            <em>Ferdydurke</em>, is a film that deliberately challenges the viewer’s expectations.
            Instead of telling a clear and coherent story, it immerses the audience in a surreal
            sequence of events that often feel illogical or unsettling. This narrative confusion is
            not a flaw, but a conscious artistic choice that reflects the philosophical foundations
            of Gombrowicz’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The film explores themes of immaturity, identity, and social pressure. Characters behave
            in exaggerated or absurd ways, and many scenes seem disconnected from one another.
            Traditional cause-and-effect storytelling is replaced by symbolism and atmosphere,
            which can make the film difficult to understand on a first viewing. The viewer is not
            guided toward meaning but instead forced to actively interpret what is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach can be frustrating, especially for audiences accustomed to conventional
            cinema. However, the confusion mirrors the protagonist’s internal struggle and the
            novel’s critique of rigid social forms. <em>30 Door Key</em> functions less as a narrative
            film and more as a philosophical experiment. While it is undeniably challenging and
            often obscure, it rewards patience and reflection, offering a unique and intellectually
            demanding cinematic experience.

        <h3>Motorboat License Exam – Completed</h3>
        <p>Last weekend, I completed the motorboat license exam. On Saturday, I took part in a full-day theoretical and practical training course at the Zegrze Reservoir. During the practical session, we practiced key maneuvers, including docking in the port at Nieporęt and the man-overboard rescue procedure. These exercises were essential parts of the practical exam and gave us a good sense of handling the boat in real conditions.</p>
        <p>I was taking the course and exam together with my father. During the week leading up to the exam, I studied regularly to stay on top of the theoretical material. My father, due to a busier schedule, had less time to prepare during the week and ended up studying for several hours on Sunday morning, just before the exam.</p>
        <p>The exam itself took place on Sunday and included both a written theory test and a practical skills assessment on the water. Both of us passed successfully.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, I visited the relevant office to submit all required documents for the issuance of our licenses. We’re now waiting for the official motorboat certificates.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, over the last few days, I’ve started browsing offers for motorboats. We’re planning to buy one, so I’ve been looking into various models, prices, and specifications to find the right option.</p>

        <h3>Drone Attack on the Night of September 9–10: A Test for NATO?</h3>
        <p>The drone incident on the night of September 9–10 was one of the most serious cross-border security events in recent months. According to official sources, several drones entered Polish airspace and were successfully intercepted and neutralized through coordinated efforts involving Polish, Dutch, and German forces under NATO command. The alliance’s quick and effective response showed that cooperation is working and that NATO’s integrated air defense system is functioning as it should.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, this was most likely a Russian operation — not necessarily a direct attack, but rather a test of NATO’s readiness and airspace defense. Some people have suggested that the drones might have come from Ukraine, but there’s no solid evidence to support that claim.</p>
        <p>There are also some interesting theories regarding Belarus’s role. It’s possible that the Belarusian authorities themselves don’t have full control or even full knowledge of what Russian troops stationed in Belarus are doing.</p>
        <p>All in all, NATO passed this test — but it’s a clear reminder that the region remains tense and that hybrid threats are very real.</p>

        <h3>School Elections: Igor Becomes Vice President</h3>
        <p>Last week, our school held elections for the student council. One of my classmates, Igor, ran for the position of student council president — and although he didn’t win the top spot, he came in second and was appointed vice president.</p>
        <p>Igor launched his campaign just one day before the election. Unlike other candidates, who had been putting up posters and campaigning for several days, Igor went for a completely different approach.</p>
        <p>I helped him out a little with the project, mostly by giving some input on the poster designs and helping him hang them around the school.</p>
        <p>Despite the late start and limited materials, Igor managed to outperform several candidates.</p>

        <h3>Reflections on Reading "Wesele" by Wyspiański</h3>
        <p>Reading Wyspiański's "Wesele" was unexpectedly challenging. The play is dense with symbolism, cultural references, and historical context that are not immediately accessible. Each character embodies social and national archetypes, making it complex to interpret their dialogue. The poetic language and metaphors required me to pause frequently, annotate the text, and consult explanatory notes to fully grasp the meaning.</p>
        <p>The social and historical layers were particularly demanding. References to Poland's partitions, rural customs, and political commentary created a text that cannot be understood superficially. For example, understanding the nuanced satire in the Poet’s and Farmer’s interactions required careful consideration of the societal tensions of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the intellectual effort was rewarding. I reflected on the symbolic wedding scene, analyzing how Wyspiański blends realism and allegory to critique national identity. This process deepened my appreciation for literature as a mirror of society and encouraged critical thinking, patience, and analytical skills.</p>
        <p>Overall, "Wesele" is a rich, layered work that challenges readers to engage deeply with language, history, and social critique. The experience emphasized the importance of context, reflection, and collaborative discussion when tackling complex texts.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the sight of the bird reminded me that observation matters.</p>
